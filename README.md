# MadboxTest
My submission for the Madbox programming test


*● How much time did this test take you ?*
I completed this test within the 5-hour time constraint

*● What was the most difficult and what made it difficult ?*
Due to the very short time constraint, I just went for whatever was easiest to make.
I made sure beforehand that there would be nothing difficult to do.

*● What could you do better in your opinion and how ?*
Prior to this test, I had not used Unity in almost 2 years.
I used up some time looking up how to implement some things in Unity.
I also used up some time trying to make Unity Remote work on my phone.

*● What would you do if you had more time to go further into this game ?*
By order of priority of what I would have implemented:
1- An animation when the character hits an obstacle (even a very basic one), which would make it feel a lot less frustrating
2- A menu scene, instead of having everything happen in the main scene
3- Implement a checkpoint system
At this point, I'd have a couple people beta-test the game to make sure I haven't forgotten any essential feature. 
4- Once I'm convinced by the prototype, I would start building more levels and making other types of obstacles.

*● What is your opinion about this test ?*
I liked this test. It was a good practice for me. 
The 5-hour time constraint is reasonable, not too long nor too short.

*● Any additional comments are more than welcome of course.*
I thought it was strange that the test demands that we use Unity.
